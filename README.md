# rust_sqlc_test
A rust project designed to test rust templates for sqlc-gen-template

This is a very simple rust project which uses sqlc along with sqlc-gen-template to generate rusqlite functions. The purpose is to test sqlc-gen-template along with rust templates. As of this writing the project depends on a pull request I just submitted to sqlc-gen-template and uses the rustqlite template I submitted to that project.
